Project Short Info: 
AtliQ Hardware is a consumer electronics company expanding rapidly but is not able to compete with other companies using data as most of their report still exists in Excel.
My goal is to implement an advanced analytics solution using Power BI that will enable the company to get insights and make informed decisions.
**************************

Project Description: 
In this project, I aimed to create a comprehensive report that serves the diverse needs of stakeholders from sales, marketing, finance, and the executive team.
The report focuses on three key areas: robust data modelling, user-empathetic report design, and drillable insights.
These elements ensure that the report is not only accurate and reliable but also intuitive and actionable for various departments.

Skills and Learnings:
1. Power Query (Basic and Advanced Operations) 
2. Basic and complex DAX formulas
3. Data modelling involving 10+ tables
4. Choosing the right visuals and formatting
5. Dashboard designing principles
6. Using bookmarks
7. Deploying in Power BI service
8. Stakeholder Feedback Implementation
9. Sales, Marketing, Finance & Supply Chain metrics

**************************
Impact and Benefits:
This project has significantly empowered stakeholders by providing them with a powerful tool to monitor, evaluate, and enhance their activities.
The robust data model ensures accurate and reliable insights, while the user-empathetic design makes the report accessible and actionable.
The drillable insights feature allows for in-depth analysis, helping stakeholders uncover new opportunities and make data-driven decisions.

By leveraging advanced data analysis techniques and incorporating stakeholder feedback, I created a report that not only meets the current needs of the business but also provides a scalable solution for future growth.
This project has equipped me with a comprehensive skill set in data analysis, report design, and stakeholder management, positioning me as a valuable asset in any data-driven organization.
